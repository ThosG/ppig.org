## Background

This list of keywords is based on a review of the index of the book Psychology of Programming, on the work of the ACM CHI Curriculum Development Group, on several online guides to thesaurus construction, and on the  devised by Margaret Burnett and Marla Baker. This list was created and is being maintained by [Alan Blackwell](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~afb21/).

## How to assign keywords to your paper
To classify a publication, please follow this procedure:

1. Choose keywords at the most specific level of the tree below. When listing keywords in a paper, give the full reference within the tree, followed by the keyword name, as follows:
"POP-I.A. Team Structure".
 
2. If no bottom-level keyword applies to your work, please try to define a further keyword that you think will be useful in future. Give the tree reference to define where it belongs in the classification structure, as follows:
"POP-III.B. ToonTalk"
 
3. Try to choose keywords from sub-trees of as many different top level branches as possible (one from POP-I, one from POP-II etc.). This will allow location of papers that use (for example) a specific research method to investigate a particular language
 
4. Try to use as few keywords as you can within any one branch.

An example of an appropriate set of keywords is for "Simulating a Software Project", a paper presented at the 9th Annual Workshop. This paper could be classified with the keywords:

```
POP-I.A. Group Dynamics; POP-II.B. Design; POP-V.B. Simulated Projects.
```

(Note that this encoding proposes "Simulated Projects" as a new keyword)
